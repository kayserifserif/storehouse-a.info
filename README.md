## Ideas

- Items representing themes of work
- Different rooms and floors (how to preview? prompt to inspect? y/n)
- Dungeon crawler: monsters, traps, puzzles, treasures
- Cipher poems: solve to get a reward!
- Log of actions (you entered this room, left this room, viewed this work, collected this item)
- The whole exhibition is a collective e-lit: everyone's log of actions collected at the end
- Why dungeon crawler? Player agency, reader agency
- The exhibition itself as the artwork.
- Entrance and exit
- Secret room after you have viewed all the works / collected all the items
- Final lobby displaying all the metadata (find the secret room buried in all the text! X-RAY GOGGLES -> quine)
- Similarities between a system of codes beneath the functional surface and a system of dungeons underground?

## Research
- Dungeon crawl is a type of scenario in fantasy rpg in which the hero navigates a labryinth environment.
- Origins (Greek Mythology) of the 'labryinth': Designed by the artificer Daedalus to hold the Minotaur.
  Daedalus himself barely escaped because it was so well made.
  Theseus was able to retrace his path with a ball of thread.

  - Is the visitor the hero or the monster?
  - Are the artists/makers of this exhibition like the artificer who barely escapes from his own labryinth?
  - Can the narrative/log be likened to the thread that allowed Theseus to navigate the maze?
  
- Dungeons are rooms/cells in which prisoners are held, usually/generally associated with Medieval castles.

  - Clash/chemistry/re-contextualisation between Medieval fantasy, Contemporary reality and Futuristic fantasy?
  - i.e. What would a spell book be in the present? A dictionary? A server with stored information?
  - Perhaps a wand would be a password reset tool? Or a decoder?
