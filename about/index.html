    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>A text and typographyâ€“based virtual exhibition showcasing interactive visual poetry inspired by the lexicon of NetHack (dungeon crawl game). The exhibition as the artwork.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Dungeon crawl is a type of scenario in fantasy rpg in which the hero navigates a labryinth environment. 
        <ul>
          <p>
            
            
          </p>
          <li>Why a dungeon crawl? Player/reader agency?
            <ul>
              <li>Recontextualisation: Dungeons are typically associated with Medieval castles, but what would a contemporary/futuristic dungeon encompass? Medieval fantasy vs. Present reality vs. Futuristic fantasy?</li>
              <li>Are we playing a role when we enter a gallery space?</li>
              <li>Similarities between a network of codes operating beneath the surface and a network of dungeons underground?</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <p>
        
        
      </p>
      <li>Origins (Greek Mythology) of the 'labryinth': Designed by the artificer Daedalus to hold the Minotaur.
        <ul>
          <p>
            
          </p>
          <li>Daedalus himself barely escaped because it was so well made.</li>
          <li>Theseus was able to retrace his path with a ball of thread.
            <ul>
              <li>Is the visitor the hero or the monster?</li>
              <li>Are the artists/makers of this exhibition like the artificer who barely escapes from his own labryinth?</li>
              <li>Can the narrative/log be likened to the thread that allowed Theseus to navigate the maze?</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
