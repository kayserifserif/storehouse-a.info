           Eve                              s,
              rything is repe*ted m*ny time
                 fourteen times, but two
             things in the world seem to be
          only once: *bove, the intric*te sun;
                below, *sterion. Perh*ps
                   I h*ve cre*ted the
                    st*rs and the sun
                    *nd this enormous
                       house, but I
                        no longer
                        remember.
                            *
                           * *
