# Storehouse-A.info

A text and typography-based virtual exhibition showcasing interactive visual poetry inspired by the lexicon of NetHack (dungeon crawl game).

Why NetHack?
- The use of punctuation in visual poetry and coding.
- Construction of a space with these parts and units that underly functions and graphics. 

Rethinking exhibition spaces:
- When physical space is difficult to rent
- Facilitates collaborative processes
- Accessibility

Traditional (physical) gallery space vs. Ours

- Gallery etiquette? Playfulness? Reader agency? 
- Not fully an art gallery, not fully a dungeon, not just a game, not just an exhibition
- Storehouse: a neutral expression
- Visual poetry as existing between genres

Visual poetry on page vs. In our space

- Poetry is being performed through the process of participation
- Requires the userâ€™s actions in order to be complete
- Value in the process of comprehension and interpretation
- Emphasis on process (echo with Dra.ft)
- Relationship with the kinetic
- works that flow/change with time

Log / narrative of action:
- (value in) documentation of the process (/journey) 

Visual poem themes:
- Reflexive on the form/punctuation or the project space
- Research-based

Loose narrative arc: nine poems to collect/inspect. Gain access to secret tenth work: source code. Project heavily based on text, and source code integral component of the textual content. Inspiration from quines, works that produce itself as output. Exit the labyrinth, see the project as a whole, infrastructure below the map. Emphasis on process as well as product.
